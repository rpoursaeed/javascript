- You are supposed to add some test cases for every challenge.

- Please only use JavaScript's standard library. 
- Write some test cases for each exercise, feel free to use your favourite test library if you need.
- All the exercises are focused on the correctness, and
  some of them also on performance.

- It's perfect if you write the big-O complexity of your solutions in comment upper the methods.

- Finally, If you have any question, feel free to ask!
